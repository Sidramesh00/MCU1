Volatile Project:-

In this project, I illustrated the use of the volatile keyword.

The example demonstrates a constant value (zero) at SRAM_ADDR.

However, during the course, the instructor changed the value at the SRAM_ADDR, which I did not include in this demonstration, as I used STM32CubeIDE for the project.
